# MAGIC
# MAGIC This example notebook demonstrates how to load the [{{ instruct_model_name }}](https://huggingface.co/{{ hf_org_name }}/{{ instruct_model_name }}) model from a Databricks Marketplace's Catalog ([see announcement blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/llama-2-foundation-models-available-databricks-lakehouse-ai)).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Environment:
# MAGIC - MLR: 14.0 GPU ML Runtime and above
# MAGIC - Instance:
{% for (cloud_name, compute_size) in peft_type.items() %}
# MAGIC     - {{ compute_size }} on {{ cloud_name }}
{% endfor %}

{% if model_family_name == "llama-2"%}
# MAGIC Requirements:
# MAGIC - To get the access of the model on HuggingFace, please visit the [Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads) and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.
